        <p>Hi, I'm Edan. I'm a Software Engineer based in Canberra, Australia.</p>
        <p>I'm experienced at learning new languages and technologies on the fly and am always ready to learn more to ensure I can use the best tool for the job.</p>
        <p>I'm ambitious and love to be challenged.</p> 
        <p>I work well in a team and am happy to co-ordinate with others to find and work on problems in the best way for every participant, and am always keen to both teach and learn from others.</p>
        <p>I'm open to all kinds of work, however as someone interested in science and problems that require algorithms to solve, I'd be exceptionally excited for work in scientific industries.</p>
        <p>If I seem like someone you'd be keen to have working for you, feel free to reach out using the details under "Contact Me".</p>
